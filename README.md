# ðŸ“Œ Project Topic

*Analyzing Sales, Customer Behavior, and Logistics at Kultra Mega Stores (KMS)*

---

## ðŸ“– Project Description

As part of the DSA Data Analysis Capstone Project, this analysis was conducted on historical order records of Kultra Mega Stores (KMS), a Lagos-based office supplies and furniture retailer. The purpose of the project was to deliver actionable insights that could help optimize business performance in areas such as customer segmentation, logistics, sales strategy, and return management. The analysis was driven by structured SQL queries and supported by dynamic dashboards built in Power BI.

## ðŸ“‚ Data Sources

The project used two primary data files:

- KMS Sql Case Study.csv â€” seated on my LMS Canvas which contains comprehensive transaction details (orders, sales, profits, shipping) between 2009â€“2012.
- Order Status.csv â€” includes only returned orders, allowing for analysis of product return behavior.

## ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Summary

The analysis addressed the following business-critical questions:

- Which product categories and regions had the highest and lowest sales?
- Who are the top-performing and underperforming customers?
- How do different shipping methods align with order priorities?
- What customer segments are associated with the most product returns?

Each of these questions was explored using SQL

### 3. Return Prevention Strategy
- Invest in customer education and pre-sale clarity (product info, usage).
- Improve packaging and delivery experience.
